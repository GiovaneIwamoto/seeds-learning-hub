This course provides a structured and hands-on learning path for building intelligent agents powered by Large Language Models. Designed for learners progressing from foundational to expert levels, the curriculum covers key concepts, tools, and frameworks used in modern agent development.

This material is part of a complementary learning path, designed to reinforce and expand the understanding of AI agents and LLMs. It brings together curated external resources—such as tutorials, documentation, research papers, and tools—that support a deeper and more practical exploration of the topics.


Rather than serving as a standalone course, this path functions as a hands-on guide to help learners move from foundational concepts to building real-world applications. It emphasizes experimentation, system design, and a modular understanding of modern agent-based development.

The aim is to provide a structured yet flexible approach to learning, allowing individuals to progress at their own pace while gaining the practical skills needed to create intelligent, tool-using agents with LLMs.
